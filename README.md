The core of the software is an artificial neural network based on the perceptron model. This network is configured as a fully-connected network with the possibility of feedback, meaning that the output of a perceptron can also be its input. The software has the ability to learn from the games it plays if the user allows it at the end of a match.

You can download mytris_neural_learning.py, run it and start playing with a basic player.

On the other hand, you can download it along with the 3 txt files in a single folder and run it, getting an expert player.
